This is a fork of [Ceto Ocean](https://github.com/Scrawk/Ceto) for Unity. My goal is to improve ocean rendering and add new features. So far, not much has changed.

### New Features

- Cube Map Reflections: Ocean now uses cubemap for more acurate sky reflections. This fixes some rendering bugs on large waves and improves overall lighting believability.

### Planned Work

- Better BRDF - would like a more physically accurate unified BRDF
- LWRP / HDRP support - LWRP is particularly interesting because of scriptable render pass
